# EFDE: Fine-Tuning a Pre-Trained Deep Learning for Vehicle Sound Classification to Detect Engine Failure
This code is an implementation of fine-tuning a pre-trained deep learning model to classify vehicle sounds as normal or engine failure. The goal of this code is to detect engine failure based on the sound generated by the engine.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this code is a small dataset with two classes: normal engine sounds and engine failure sounds. The dataset is generated randomly using NumPy, but in practice, you would use real-world data.

The dataset is split into three parts: training, validation, and testing sets. The size of each set is defined in the code.

# Pre-Trained Model
This code uses MobileNetV2, a pre-trained model that has been trained on the ImageNet dataset. The model is loaded and its layers are frozen so that the pre-trained weights are not updated during training.

# Fine-Tuned Model
A custom classifier is added to the pre-trained model to classify the engine sounds. The custom classifier includes a GlobalAveragePooling2D layer, followed by a dense layer with 1024 units and ReLU activation, and a final dense layer with a sigmoid activation that outputs a probability between 0 and 1 for each input sample.

# Data Generators
The data generators are used to generate batches of data for training, validation, and testing. The training data is augmented by applying random transformations such as scaling, shearing, and flipping.

# Training
The fine-tuned model is trained on the training data using the fit_generator method. The validation data is used to monitor the model's performance during training.

# Testing
The final accuracy of the model is evaluated using the testing data.

# Saving the Model
The fine-tuned model is saved to a file using the save method.

# Requirements
keras &
numpy

# Running the Code
Install the required libraries using pip or conda.
Run the code in a Python environment.
The final accuracy of the model will be printed to the console, and the fine-tuned model will be saved to a file named 'fine-tuned-model.h5'.
